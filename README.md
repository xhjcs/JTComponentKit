# JTComponentKit

## Overview

**JTComponentKit** abstracts each section of a `UICollectionView` into distinct components, with each component responsible for implementing UICollectionView delegate methods. This design allows for cleaner separation of concerns by dividing the collection view into independent, reusable modules. By isolating the logic of each section, it simplifies the maintenance of complex layouts and facilitates better reuse of UI components across different screens. Additionally, this approach encourages scalability and enhances the testability of each section individually, fostering a more flexible and modular UI development process.

## Features

- **Component-based architecture**: Each section of the `UICollectionView` is treated as a separate component, responsible for its own delegate methods.
- **Decoupling**: Promotes a clean separation of concerns by dividing the view logic into independent modules.
- **Reusability**: Components can easily be reused across different sections of the same `UICollectionView` or across different screens.
- **Scalability**: Helps maintain large and complex layouts by organizing them into manageable parts.
- **Testability**: Enhances the ability to unit test individual sections without depending on the entire view logic.

## Installation
